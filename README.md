## Disclaimer

I'm doing it just for fun, so... use at your own risk.

I hope it will become something great.

^-^

## Usage

First build the .g files for Serializable (if you clone the repo):

`dart run build_runner build`

A simple usage example:

```dart
import 'package:scrobblenaut/scrobblenaut.dart';

// A simple example...
// For more, check the example folder.
void main() async {
  final lastFMAuth = await LastFM.noAuth(apiKey: APIValues.API);
  final scrobblenaut = Scrobblenaut(lastFM: lastFMAuth);

  // Start using the Wrapper...
}

```

## Get Scrobblenaut

Add Scrobblenaut dependency on `pubspec.yaml`:

From GitHub (for example: branch-name >> dev-build):

```yaml
dependencies:
  scrobblenaut:
    git: https://github.com/Nebulino/Scrobblenaut.git
      ref: branch-name
```

From pub.dev:

```yaml
dependencies:
  scrobblenaut: ^version-number
```

## Features and bugs

### Status

All the methods are available.
Needs more time to check for problems caused by a bad information management from the API side.
For example:

- Tracks duration information taken from an album like method is different from a Track duration taken from a
  track info query.

- Some variables can have strange content such as FIXME on some Track duration.

- Many more. For now with my tests, this is the best I can handle. I just need more track and usage of my package
  to track different type of errors that can occurs.

### Future of the package after all methods implemented

It's still a long way.
I have some ideas, and I'm going to continue to support it, just stay tuned.

### For the documentation

For now, You have to download the repo and run _dartdoc_ on the console,
on the root of the package. When I upload this package on _pub.dev_ you can use the documentation from there directly.

There's 2 type of usage:

- with authentication;
- without authentication.

Please file feature requests and bugs at the [issue tracker][tracker].
